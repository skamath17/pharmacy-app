# AI Code Tracking Guide

This document explains how to track AI-generated code in this repository.

## Quick Start

To generate a report of AI-generated code:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\analyze-ai-code.ps1
```

**Linux/Mac (Bash):**
```bash
chmod +x analyze-ai-code.sh
./analyze-ai-code.sh
```

**Detailed Report:**
```powershell
.\analyze-ai-code.ps1 -Detailed
```

## How It Works

The script analyzes git commit history and identifies AI-generated code by searching for:
- **Keywords in commit messages:** `cursor`, `ai`, `assistant`, `generated`, `composer`, etc.
- **Author names/emails:** Any mentions of AI tools
- **Code statistics:** Files changed, lines added/deleted

## Best Practices for Tracking

### 1. Commit Message Convention

Use prefixes in your commit messages:

```
[AI] Add medicine catalog feature
[Cursor] Implement shopping cart service
[AI-Cursor] Add order management with payment integration
[Manual] Fix prescription upload bug
```

### 2. Code Comments

Add comments in AI-generated code:

```typescript
// Generated by Cursor AI Assistant
// This component was created with AI assistance on 2025-01-10
```

```java
/**
 * Generated by Cursor AI Assistant
 * Service for managing medicine catalog operations
 */
```

### 3. Git Configuration

Set up commit message template:

```bash
git config commit.template .gitmessage
```

### 4. Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

```
feature/ai-catalog-service
feature/cursor-order-management
bugfix/manual-prescription-upload
```

## Report Output

The script generates `ai-code-report.md` with:

- **Summary Statistics:** Total commits, AI commits, percentages
- **Code Metrics:** Files changed, lines added/deleted
- **Commit List:** Detailed list of AI-related commits
- **Recommendations:** How to improve tracking

## Limitations

The script relies on:
1. **Commit messages** - Only works if commits mention AI tools
2. **Keyword matching** - May miss commits without keywords
3. **Manual tracking** - Requires discipline to tag commits

## Improving Accuracy

To get more accurate results:

1. **Always tag AI commits** with `[AI]` or `[Cursor]` prefix
2. **Add code comments** in AI-generated files
3. **Use consistent naming** for AI-related branches
4. **Run reports regularly** to track trends

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make changes with Cursor
# 2. Stage files
git add .

# 3. Commit with AI tag
git commit -m "[AI-Cursor] Add medicine catalog search functionality"

# 4. Generate report periodically
./analyze-ai-code.ps1

# 5. Review report
cat ai-code-report.md
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Git hooks to prompt for AI usage
- [ ] Integration with Cursor API (if available)
- [ ] Code pattern analysis (style detection)
- [ ] Historical trend graphs
- [ ] Export to JSON/CSV for analysis

## Questions?
